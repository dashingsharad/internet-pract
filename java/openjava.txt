If you added it in the control panel while your command prompt was open, that won't affect your current command prompt. You'll need to exit and re-open or simply do:

set path="%path%;c:\program files\java\jdk1.6.0_16\bin"
By way of checking, execute:

echo %path%
from your command prompt and let us know what it is.

Otherwise, make sure there is a javac in that directory by trying:

"c:\program files\java\jdk1.6.0_16\bin\javac.exe"
